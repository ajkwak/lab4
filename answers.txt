REFLECTIONS
*******************

This lab was quite fun!  I had been curious as to how lists were displayed on
android.  I knew it was possible, because the NPR News app always shows lists
of stories, but I had no idea of the implementation.  It was very interesting
to learn -- although I had to read the code a couple of times before I
understood what was happening!  I’m looking forward to using this on my own
app(s?).  Getting a feeling of what it’s like working with other people in Git
was also interesting.  Most of my work has been on a repo to which only I
contribute.  However, the merging (even when there were merge conflicts) was
surprisingly easy.
